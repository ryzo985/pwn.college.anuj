# Intro to Arguments

After connection, we were asked to execute ``hello hackers`` (command + argument) in the terminal. After completion we were given the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:'pwn.college{ML_a4wvW8nZ4Ne6SbYUDa8YHTvO.QX4YjM1wyN4ETMzEzW}'** 

I input ``hello hackers`` where hello was the command and hackers was the argument and then received the flag.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ML_a4wvW8nZ4Ne6SbYUDa8YHTvO.QX4YjM1wyN4ETMzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ 
```

## What I learned

I learned about arguments, and that they're additional data that's passed to the command. When using the terminal, the first word is the command and the subsequent words are arguments.
