# Command history

We were asked to go back in the history of the terminal using the up arrow to obtain the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:'pwn.college{sSfv175jP_MIa1AHIBv9l0ogRhe.0lNzEzNxwyN4ETMzEzW}'** 

After connection, I used the up arrow and the flag came into the input. I hit enter and then copy pasted it.

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{sSfv175jP_MIa1AHIBv9l0ogRhe.0lNzEzNxwyN4ETMzEzW}
bash: the: command not found
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ 
```

## What I learned

I learned that i can naviagte through the commands previously inputted (Command history) using the up and down arrow keys.
