# Intro to Commands 

Here we were asked to execute the ``hello`` command in the terminal after connection and after entering it we recieve the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{srVyjqvtprhGbjCIrlJu0yIm6sE.QX3YjM1wyN4ETMzEzW}'

I input the ``hello`` command into the linux terminal to receive the flag.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{srVyjqvtprhGbjCIrlJu0yIm6sE.QX3YjM1wyN4ETMzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ 
```
## What I learned

I learned how to run commands in the linux terminal, and how output from the terminal is given.
