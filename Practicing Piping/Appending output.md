# Appending output

Here, we were asked to run ``/challenge/run`` with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file */home/hacker/the-flag*. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to stdout if stdout is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in truncation mode (>), the second half will overwrite the first and you won't get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag: 'pwn.college{EWcNXO3wCGGDyxM5TUShV1hCfxA.QX3ATO0wyN4ETMzEzW}'**

I ran ``/challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag`` which redirected the output of "/challenge/run" to */home/hacker/the-flag* in append-mode as I used ">>" and not ">". This satisfied all the execution requirements, and so the first part of the flag was written to the file and the second part was appended to the file as well. I then ran ``cat  /home/hacker/the-flag`` to read the file and receive the flag.

```bash

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do 
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout 
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the 
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll 
get the whole flag!

\|/ This is the first half:
 v 
pwn.college{EWcNXO3wCGGDyxM5TUShV1hCfxA.QX3ATO0wyN4ETMzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>) 
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout 
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append 
mode!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ 
```


## What I learned
I learned that the when using the ">" character to redirect output, it creates a new file output every time. So when we want to keep adding the output of commands to the same file over time, we use it in *append* mode, with ">>" instead of ">".
