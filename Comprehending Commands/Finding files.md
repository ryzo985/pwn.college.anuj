# Finding files

We were told to use the ``find`` command, which takes optional arguments describing the search criteria and the search location, to find the hidden flag which is in a random directory on the filesystem. There are other files named flag, and we were told to find the correct one. After catting the file, we receive the flag.

## My solve
**Flag: 'pwn.college{kji5UdxWMYxqBT2SUHfqc5ml37Y.QXyMDO0wyN4ETMzEzW}'**

Since we were told that the flag is hidden somewhere on the filesystem, we can keep the search criteria as the root directory "/". The search criteria can be "flag" as the flag is usually named just that. This listed many locations. Trying to ``cat`` the first location failed as it was just a directory named flag. The second location luckily returned the flag. So, running ``cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/include/config/x86/acpi/cpufreq/flag`` gave us the flag.

## What I learned
I learned that the ``find`` command takes optional arguments describing the search criteria and the search location. If you don't specify a search criteria, find matches every file. If you don't specify a search location, find uses the current working directory. So, you do ``find``, and you then follow it up with the search location, then "-name" and then the search criteria. **"find search_location -name search_criteria"**.
